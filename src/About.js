      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I created this application out of a desire to further increase my skills in reactJS, and programming in general. When im on youtube, i mostly watch programming videos, and there's been times in which i didn't feel like fully opening up EverNote, i'd have to sign in, create a shared pane with the video im watch on desktop.</p>
      <p>Code and Learn solves that problem, users can create an account, save videos to watch later, while also having the ability to take notes within the same window. Users have the ability to either sign up, or use the application anonymously through Google's proprietary firebase authentication API  </p>
      <p>This is still a work in progress, and i am still adding features</p>
